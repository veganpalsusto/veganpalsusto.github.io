&lt;p>Louise Jane, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.veganchoiceawards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Vegan Choice Awards&lt;/a>
was kind to share the following words with about our product:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vegans, rejoice!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>There is now a Mexican home bakery in the UK that makes Vegan Conchas and they are a dream come true! If you&amp;rsquo;ve never tried Conchas, then it&amp;rsquo;s high time you did. And this company makes the best ones around. You can tell that their products are carefully crafted with the greatest of care, resulting in a big difference in quality between their baked goods, and those mass-produced and found in stores. The bread is soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of sweetness and the famous shell topping is baked to absolute perfection.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>They&amp;rsquo;re the perfect anytime treat, but they go especially well with a morning cup of coffee. They make great gifts, too, but once you taste them, you might not want to share! Be sure to follow them on &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/vegan.palsusto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram&lt;/a> for your chance to get in on the action! You won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on Concha Day! Both flavours are a must-try!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
