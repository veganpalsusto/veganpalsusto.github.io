This is an award earned &lt;strong>solely on taste&lt;/strong>, no branding or company name are presented to the panel of experts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We cannot describe how honoured we feel for this, the product that started everything for us getting such a distinct recognition.
We are extremely grateful to our costumers, who&amp;rsquo;s lovely feedback gave us the confidence to apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check the &lt;a href="https://gff.co.uk/directory/producer/?id=58543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild of Fine Food&amp;rsquo;s Directory&lt;/a> to
see our product and all the other awardees. Congratulations to all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the specific feedback from the expert judges:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Instantly likeable, with a richness that you would not expect from a vegan food, the sweetness of the product is perfectly balanced, visually appealing, has a very good crumb structure and retains a pleasantly crisp crust. A very enjoyable sweet bread.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;A prettily shaped and well-baked bun, tender and lightly aromatic from the vanilla. The sweet potato has worked well to provide moistness and sweetness, as well as richness in the absence of egg or dairy. We love the gentle crunch of the vanilla sugar. Cleverly executed and easily enjoyable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pa'l Susto at the The Future Market!</title><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/event/24-07-12-futuremarket-july/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/event/24-07-12-futuremarket-july/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="attention-all-vegans-and-_pan-dulce_-lovers">Attention all vegans and &lt;em>pan dulce&lt;/em> lovers!&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Louise Jane, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.veganchoiceawards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Vegan Choice Awards&lt;/a>
was kind to share the following words with about our products:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pan-de-muerto">Pan de Muerto:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something delectable to help you celebrate the Day of the Dead, Pa&amp;rsquo;l Susto&amp;rsquo;s Vegan Pan de Muerto is hard to beat. This mouthwatering bread will make your taste buds sing!&lt;/em>
&lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s so much more than just a delicious treat. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to connect with Mexican culture, especially when you learn all about the special tradition and history behind this irresistible, zesty, sugar-topped delight.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I loved the taste so much that this product has become a permanent part of my life, and I highly recommend checking this incredible company out if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a sweet connection to the spirit (and otherworldly deliciousness!!!)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="marranitos">Marranitos&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of all of the sweet offerings from Pa‚Äôl Susto, and these marranitos are no exception!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Like everything else from this brand, these are baked to absolute perfection. They&amp;rsquo;re similar to gingerbread, but even tastier, and they have this incredible texture that&amp;rsquo;s somewhere between cake and a cookie. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of pigs as a symbol of luck, so these little piggies are a surefire way to spread good vibes.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Forget milk and cookies: Milk and marranitos are the way forward! If you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried them before, these marranitos are really the best you&amp;rsquo;ll find anywhere! And they&amp;rsquo;re completely Vegan!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pop-up at Westfield Stratford</title><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/event/23-04-30-popup-stratford/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/event/23-04-30-popup-stratford/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="attention-all-vegans-and-_pan-dulce_-lovers">Attention all vegans and &lt;em>pan dulce&lt;/em> lovers!&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Louise Jane, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.veganchoiceawards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Vegan Choice Awards&lt;/a>
was kind to share the following words with about our product:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vegans, rejoice!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>There is now a Mexican home bakery in the UK that makes Vegan Conchas and they are a dream come true! If you&amp;rsquo;ve never tried Conchas, then it&amp;rsquo;s high time you did. And this company makes the best ones around. You can tell that their products are carefully crafted with the greatest of care, resulting in a big difference in quality between their baked goods, and those mass-produced and found in stores. The bread is soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of sweetness and the famous shell topping is baked to absolute perfection.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>They&amp;rsquo;re the perfect anytime treat, but they go especially well with a morning cup of coffee. They make great gifts, too, but once you taste them, you might not want to share! Be sure to follow them on &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/vegan.palsusto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram&lt;/a> for your chance to get in on the action! You won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on Concha Day! Both flavours are a must-try!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/contact/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/custom-orders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/custom-orders/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/how-to-order/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/how-to-order/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/menu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/menu/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gallery</title><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/gallery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/gallery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Tour</title><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/tour/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/tour/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
