&lt;p>Louise Jane, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.veganchoiceawards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Vegan Choice Awards&lt;/a>
was kind to share the following words with about our products:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pan-de-muerto">Pan de Muerto:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something delectable to help you celebrate the Day of the Dead, Pa&amp;rsquo;l Susto&amp;rsquo;s Vegan Pan de Muerto is hard to beat. This mouthwatering bread will make your taste buds sing!&lt;/em>
&lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s so much more than just a delicious treat. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to connect with Mexican culture, especially when you learn all about the special tradition and history behind this irresistible, zesty, sugar-topped delight.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I loved the taste so much that this product has become a permanent part of my life, and I highly recommend checking this incredible company out if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a sweet connection to the spirit (and otherworldly deliciousness!!!)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="marranitos">Marranitos&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of all of the sweet offerings from Pa’l Susto, and these marranitos are no exception!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Like everything else from this brand, these are baked to absolute perfection. They&amp;rsquo;re similar to gingerbread, but even tastier, and they have this incredible texture that&amp;rsquo;s somewhere between cake and a cookie. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of pigs as a symbol of luck, so these little piggies are a surefire way to spread good vibes.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Forget milk and cookies: Milk and marranitos are the way forward! If you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried them before, these marranitos are really the best you&amp;rsquo;ll find anywhere! And they&amp;rsquo;re completely Vegan!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pop-up at Westfield Stratford</title><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/event/23-04-30-popup-stratford/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/event/23-04-30-popup-stratford/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="attention-all-vegans-and-_pan-dulce_-lovers">Attention all vegans and &lt;em>pan dulce&lt;/em> lovers!&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Louise Jane, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.veganchoiceawards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Vegan Choice Awards&lt;/a>
was kind to share the following words with about our product:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vegans, rejoice!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>There is now a Mexican home bakery in the UK that makes Vegan Conchas and they are a dream come true! If you&amp;rsquo;ve never tried Conchas, then it&amp;rsquo;s high time you did. And this company makes the best ones around. You can tell that their products are carefully crafted with the greatest of care, resulting in a big difference in quality between their baked goods, and those mass-produced and found in stores. The bread is soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of sweetness and the famous shell topping is baked to absolute perfection.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>They&amp;rsquo;re the perfect anytime treat, but they go especially well with a morning cup of coffee. They make great gifts, too, but once you taste them, you might not want to share! Be sure to follow them on &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/vegan.palsusto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram&lt;/a> for your chance to get in on the action! You won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on Concha Day! Both flavours are a must-try!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/contact/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/custom-orders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/custom-orders/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/how-to-order/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/how-to-order/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/menu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/menu/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gallery</title><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/gallery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/gallery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Tour</title><link>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/tour/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/tour/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
