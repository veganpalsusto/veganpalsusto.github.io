This mouthwatering bread will make your taste buds sing! It’s so much more than just a delicious treat. It’s an opportunity to connect with Mexican culture, especially when you learn all about the special tradition and history behind this irresistible, zesty, sugar-topped delight.\nI loved the taste so much that this product has become a permanent part of my life, and I highly recommend checking this incredible company out if you’re looking for a sweet connection to the spirit (and otherworldly deliciousness!!!)\nMarranitos I’m a huge fan of all of the sweet offerings from Pa’l Susto, and these marranitos are no exception!\nLike everything else from this brand, these are baked to absolute perfection. They’re similar to gingerbread, but even tastier, and they have this incredible texture that’s somewhere between cake and a cookie. I’ve always thought of pigs as a symbol of luck, so these little piggies are a surefire way to spread good vibes.\nForget milk and cookies: Milk and marranitos are the way forward! If you haven’t tried them before, these marranitos are really the best you’ll find anywhere!

If you’ve never tried Conchas, then it’s high time you did. And this company makes the best ones around. You can tell that their products are carefully crafted with the greatest of care, resulting in a big difference in quality between their baked goods, and those mass-produced and found in stores. The bread is soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of sweetness and the famous shell topping is baked to absolute perfection.\nThey’re the perfect anytime treat, but they go especially well with a morning cup of coffee. They make great gifts, too, but once you taste them, you might not want to share! Be sure to follow them on Instagram for your chance to get in on the action! You won’t want to miss out on Concha Day! Both flavours are a must-try!\n","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677628800,"objectID":"1bdeab2ce6a8046514e09d5a14735431","permalink":"https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/post/23-03-01-palsusto-vca/","publishdate":"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-03-01-palsusto-vca/","section":"post","summary":"We are very happy to announce that both of our classic flavours, vanilla and cacao, received this honour!\n","tags":["Vegan Conchas UK","Vegan Mexican Bakery","Vegan Choice Awards"],"title":"Vegan Pa'l Susto Awarded by Vegan Choice Award!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ce3add0143655803de5d19d429a04091","permalink":"https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/custom-orders/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/custom-orders/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7189c3bd50eb658f8e70562936de1e96","permalink":"https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/how-to-order/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/how-to-order/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"de066499dde85c09b633268c83f36f9e","permalink":"https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/menu/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/menu/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"665288c8761d48eb3366c37954243edc","permalink":"https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/gallery/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Gallery","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]
