If you’ve never tried Conchas, then it’s high time you did. And this company makes the best ones around. You can tell that their products are carefully crafted with the greatest of care, resulting in a big difference in quality between their baked goods, and those mass-produced and found in stores. The bread is soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of sweetness and the famous shell topping is baked to absolute perfection.\nThey’re the perfect anytime treat, but they go especially well with a morning cup of coffee. They make great gifts, too, but once you taste them, you might not want to share! Be sure to follow them on Instagram for your chance to get in on the action! You won’t want to miss out on Concha Day!
