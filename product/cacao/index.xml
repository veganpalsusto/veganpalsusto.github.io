      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are very happy to announce that both of our classic flavours, vanilla and cacao, received this honour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise Jane, CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.veganchoiceawards.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Vegan Choice Awards&lt;/a&gt;
was kind to share the following words with about our product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegans, rejoice!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is now a Mexican home bakery in the UK that makes Vegan Conchas and they are a dream come true! If you&amp;rsquo;ve never tried Conchas, then it&amp;rsquo;s high time you did. And this company makes the best ones around. You can tell that their products are carefully crafted with the greatest of care, resulting in a big difference in quality between their baked goods, and those mass-produced and found in stores. The bread is soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of sweetness and the famous shell topping is baked to absolute perfection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re the perfect anytime treat, but they go especially well with a morning cup of coffee. They make great gifts, too, but once you taste them, you might not want to share! Be sure to follow them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/vegan.palsusto&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; for your chance to get in on the action! You won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on Concha Day! Both flavours are a must-try!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
